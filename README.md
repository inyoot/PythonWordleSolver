# Python Wordle Solver
Python Solver for Wordle Puzzle

It began with the Jumble puzzle, which I used when teaching at the College of the Ozarks, utilizing the book "Think Python" by Allen Downey.
My Python course gained popularity, and some of my  fellow professors showed me the Wordle puzzle when we were in line for the graduation ceremony.
I decided to come back to university for my terminal degree (Ph.D. in Computer Engineering). There is an elderly lady in the church who plays Wordle daily. I decided to join her in solving the Wordle puzzle daily. Of course, I did it with the Python programming language and challenged myself to write it in list comprehension style. I am using Google Colab and its assistant, Gemini AI. I asked for a review of my code in [CodeReview Solver for Wordle puzzle](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/296053/solver-for-wordle-puzzle)

The Wordle Solver was evolving from the original version as I used it every day to solve a new puzzle. The word frequency from Kaggle was limited, and I found several new word frequency lexicons and even several methods to generate it more accurately. The Python Wordle Solver is circulating among fellow students and professors at Missouri Science and Technology University. A prospective new Ph.D student, [Narayan Adhikari](https://github.com/adhikarinarayan/), suggests applying a machine learning method to solve this puzzle. We are now collaborating together in this Wordle Solver Github repo to come up with baseline code for reinforcement learning, specifically Q-learning.
